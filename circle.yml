# CircleCI configuration
# ======================
#
# This page describes how to setup CircleCI version 2.0
# for a project built on top of DOLFIN. Tests are run
# using FEniCS docker images, in particular using an
# image with the development version of FEniCS.
#
# For details, see also `the FEniCS Docker reference manual
# <http://fenics-containers.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
#
# Use CircleCI 2.0. It has native support for Docker images.::

version: 2

# Specify build jobs::

jobs:
  build:

# ``image`` specifies a Docker image with the development
# version of FEniCS. Inside of a container we will be using
# a user ``fenics`` which has an installation of FEniCS.
# But we will work in a different directory derived from
# the name of the project. The ``environment`` needs to
# be adjusted to allow importing C++ DOLFIN libraries and
# finding necessary files for just-in-time compilation.
# This is done because CircleCI bypasses environment setup
# specified in the FEniCS image.::

    docker:
      - image: quay.io/fenicsproject/dev
        user: fenics
        environment:
          LD_LIBRARY_PATH: /home/fenics/local/lib
          CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: /home/fenics/local
          MPLBACKEND: Agg
    working_directory: /home/fenics/fenapack

# First step is checking out the source code into
# the working directory::

    steps:
      - checkout

# Then print some diagnostic information to a build log::

      - run:
          name: Environment and FEniCS version info
          command: |
            echo $USER $HOME $PWD $PATH $LD_LIBRARY_PATH $CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
            python3 -c'import ffc; print(ffc.git_commit_hash(), ffc.ufc_signature())'
            python3 -c'import dolfin; print(dolfin.git_commit_hash())'

# Install the project from the working directory.::

      - run:
          name: Install FENaPack
          command: |
            pip3 install -v --user .

# Try to import the project. That involves some just-in-time
# compilation which we test and measure as a separate build
# step.::

      - run:
          name: Import FENaPack first time (JIT)
          command: python3 -c"import fenapack"

# Run the unit tests using `the pytest framework
# <https://pytest.org>`_. By ``-svl`` options we make a test
# output more verbose and using ``--junitxml`` we save a
# test result in machine-readable format. In a later step
# we tell to CircleCI where the result is. CircleCI is able
# to provide various information based on the results on
# its web UI.::

      - run:
          name: Unit tests
          command: py.test-3 test/unit -svl --junitxml /tmp/circle/unit.xml

# Now we run parallel unit tests. This would normally be
# done by just prefixing a ``py.test`` command by an
# ``mpirun`` command. Here we wrap it in the ``bash``
# instance to figure out an MPI rank number using the
# ``${OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK:-$PMI_RANK}`` variable, which
# should work both with MPICH and OpenMPI, and use it
# to generate separate test result files.::

      - run:
          name: Unit tests MPI
          command: >
            mpirun -n 3 bash -c '
            py.test-3 test/unit -svl
            --junitxml /tmp/circle/unit-mpi-${OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK:-$PMI_RANK}.xml
            '

# Now we run the benchmarking suite and store generated PDF
# files for later use. Note that we tell to a shell (note
# that every build step is run in a separate shell) not to
# exit on first failure by ``set +e``. Instead we only want
# to eventually fail only on the ``py.test`` command by
# returning its exit code by ``exit $rc``.::

      - run:
          name: Bench
          command: |
            set +e
            py.test-3 test/bench -svl --junitxml /tmp/circle/bench.xml
            rc=$?
            mv *.pdf /tmp/circle
            exit $rc

# Now we run the regression tests implemented by a homebrew
# Python script ``test.py``. We copy resulting figures to
# directory where CircleCI collects artifacts.::

      - run:
          name: Regression tests
          command: |
            set +e
            cd test/regression
            NP=3 python3 -u test.py
            rc=$?
            cd ../../demo; find -name "*.pdf" -exec cp --parents {} /tmp/circle \;
            exit $rc

# Install defcon and run test demo
      - run:
          name: Run defcon demo
          command: |
            CC=mpicc HDF5_MPI=ON pip3 install --no-cache-dir --user --no-binary=h5py h5py
            pip3 install --no-cache-dir --user git+https://bitbucket.org/pefarrell/defcon
            python3 -c"import defcon"
            python3 demo/defcon/mesh/genmesh.py 120
            cd demo/defcon && mpirun -n 2 python3 navier-stokes.py
            mkdir -p /tmp/circle/defcon && cp bifurcation.pdf /tmp/circle/defcon

# Finally we tell to CircleCI to store build artifacts
# and test results, which both can be accessed on
# CircleCI website.::

      - store_artifacts:
          path: /tmp/circle
          destination: build

      - store_test_results:
          path: /tmp/circle
